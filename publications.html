                    <p class="text-md mt-2 text-gray-700">Abstract: Hydrogen is the new age alternative energy source to combat energy demand and climate change. Storage of hydrogen is vital for a nationâ€™s growth. Works of literature provide different methods for storing the produced hydrogen, and the rational selection of a viable method is crucial for promoting sustainability and green practices. Typically, hydrogen storage is associated with diverse sustainable and circular economy (SCE) criteria. As a result, the authors consider the situation a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Studies infer that previous models for hydrogen storage method (HSM) selection (i) do not consider preferences in the natural language form; (ii) weights of experts are not methodically determined; (iii) hesitation of experts during criteria weight assessment is not effectively explored; and (iv) three-stage solution of a suitable selection of HSM is unexplored. Driven by these gaps, in this paper, authors put forward a new integrated framework, which considers double hierarchy linguistic information for rating, criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) for expert weight calculation, evidence-based Bayesian method for criteria weight estimation, and combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) for ranking HSMs. The applicability of the developed framework is testified by using a case example of HSM selection in India. Sensitivity and comparative analysis reveal the merits and limitations of the developed framework.</p>
